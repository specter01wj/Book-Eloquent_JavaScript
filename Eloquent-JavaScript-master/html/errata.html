<p>These are the known mistakes in the <strong>third edition</strong>
of the book. For errata in the first edition,
see <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/errata.html">this
page</a>. For the second edition,
see <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/2nd_edition/errata.html">this
page</a>. To report a problem that is not listed
here, <a href="mailto:marijnh@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.</p>

<p>Issues whose page number is followed by an ordinal number are only
present up to the print denoted by that number. I.e. those followed by
“1st” were fixed in the second print.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>Page 34</strong> (1st) <em>Updating Bindings Succintly</em>: Where it
says <code>counter-</code> it should be <code>counter--</code>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>Page 111</strong> <em>Inheritance</em>: In the second
paragraph below the example code, instead of “<code>content</code>
method”, the text should say “<code>element</code> function”.

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>Page 134</strong> <em>Error Propagation</em>: In the third
paragraph of the section, a function <code>promptInteger</code> is
referred to. The function is actually
called <code>promptNumber</code>, and the word “whole” should be
dropped from the sentence (it accepts non-whole numbers, too).</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>Page 168</strong> (1st) <em>Modules as Building Blocks</em>: In “each
needs it own private scope“, it should say “<em>its</em> own private
scope“.

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>Page 285</strong> <em>Pausing the Game</em>: The text
refers to the <code>arrow</code> binding, where it should
say <code>arrowKeys</code>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p><strong>Page 369</strong> (1st) <em>Directory
Creation</em>: <code>MKCOL</code> stands for “make collection”, not “make
column” as the book claims.</p>
